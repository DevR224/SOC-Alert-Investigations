## 📌 Alert Overview

- **Platform:** LetsDefend  
- **Alert Name:** SOC335 – CVE-2024-49138 Exploitation Detected  
- **Event ID:** 313  
- **Detection Type:** Privilege Escalation + C2 Communication  
- **Affected Host:** Victor  
- **Internal IP:** 172.16.17.207  

---

## 🧠 Incident Summary

On January 22, 2025 at 02:37 AM, the host **Victor** downloaded a suspicious file from the internet.  
The activity led to:

- Malicious PowerShell execution  
- Archive download and extraction  
- Execution of staged payload (`svchost.exe`)  
- Command-and-Control (C2) communication  
- Privilege escalation behavior  

The malware was **not quarantined**, and containment was required.

---

## 🔎 Technical Analysis

### 1️⃣ Suspicious Process Behavior

A scheduled execution of:

```
svchost.exe
```

Although `svchost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, Windows does not normally schedule it this way.  
This indicates abuse of a legitimate binary for persistence.

---

### 2️⃣ Malware Staging Behavior

Observed PowerShell behavior:

- Downloads password-protected archive  
- Extracts archive using 7-Zip  
- Deletes original archive (anti-forensics)  
- Executes payload from extracted directory  

This pattern is consistent with malware staging and privilege escalation chains.
